# KnowYourHazards Tool

This is a public, open-access environmental hazard classification tool that mimics the OCNS/CHARM model logic used in marine regulatory assessments. Built with Streamlit, it allows manual entry of toxicity, bioaccumulation, and persistence data to generate a ranked hazard statement based on regulatory criteria.

## Features
- GESAMP score extraction
- Metal and mixture hazard thresholds
- Elevation logic for persistent substances
- GHS phrase integration
- Fully hosted, web-based interface
